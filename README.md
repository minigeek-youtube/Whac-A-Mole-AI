# Welcome to the Whac-A-Mole-AI!
# Instructions:
1. You will need a code editor (a python compiler). I use Visual Studio Code, although I recommend IDLE. Watch the beginning of my python tutorial: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR5jPT4JLts&t=44s) to learn how to set it up.
2. Press on the green button at the top of this page, that says "Clone or download".
3. Press on that, and then press on "Download ZIP".
4. In your downloads, extract the ZIP file (right click > extract files).
5. Open IDLE (as shown in the video) and press on file > open > "Whac-A-Mole-Ai.py"
6. At the top, press on run, then "Run Module" (F5).
7. It should open the game up. Wait around 15 sec, before it scrolls down and begins setting up the game.
